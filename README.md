Andrew Perkins Challenge 1 Repo for refactoring Horiseon

## Description

Horiseon marketing agency requires some refactoring of their code so that it meets accessibility best practices.

## Code Updates

- For this project, I have gone through their base html to ensure that it follows a logical structure and includes semantic elements.
- I checked all images to ensure they include alt attributes.
- I checked that heading attributes fall in sequential order.
- I modified the title element to be more descriptive.
- I checked to ensure all links function properly.
- I consolidated CSS selectors and properties, and commented the CSS file with these changes.
